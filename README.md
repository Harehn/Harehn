## Hi there!
<!--
**Harehn/Harehn** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

Welcome to my GitHub Profile.
I’m currently working on my [basics project](https://github.com/Harehn/Basics). 
But I have other repositories that may be interesting to you.

## About me
My preferred name is Nitin (He/Him). I recently graduated from Mcgill University in Bachelor of Software Engineering. 
I am quite passionate about programming and problems solving.
My language of choice is **Python** closely followed by **Java**.
I also have a lot of experience with **C**, **Ocaml** and **Javascript**. 
I have also dabbled in several other languages and frameworks.


I am currently very interested in designing tests, documentation and methods to write clean code.


## Projects

### 1. [Basics](https://github.com/Harehn/Basics)
_A personal project that demonstrates the basics of a programming language_

I have created this project to act as a cheatsheet for the languages I know. 
This makes it easy to refer back to what I know and also makes sure I have a basic grasp on a language.
The basics include Variable Types, Objects, Type Casting, Comments, Arithmetics, Arrays,
Logic Flow(IfElse, While/for loop etc.), Printing, User Input (Console and interactive),
Randomness, File IO and (Higher Order) Functions. I will occasionally add more depending on the language.

I also intend to add some sorting and miscellaneous code to these branches, so I can refer to them easily.

**Languages(So Far):** Python, Java, Ocaml, C, JavaScript\

### 2.  [Scenic](https://github.com/ArenBabikian/Scenic/tree/master)
_Capstone group project – Creating test cases for autonomous driving cars_

This was my final year project for Bachelor of Software Engineering. 
The project was initially forked by our supervisor from [BerkeleyLearnVerify](https://github.com/BerkeleyLearnVerify/Scenic).
Several iterations have been made on the project since. The project's goal is to create a simulation for autonomous vehicles
and to create test cases so that we can be more rigorous in software testing of autonomous vehicles.

Our group focused on the optimisation of SAT solving and NSGA creation of test cases. 

**Supervisor:** [Aren Babikian](https://github.com/ArenBabikian) \
**Team Members:** [Zhekai Jiang](https://github.com/zhekai-jiang), [Jerry Hou-Liu](https://github.com/JryHL), Oliver Huang\
**Language:** Python, Bash, markdown, Json \
**Technologies:** pytest, NSGA, pymoo, Poetry, Toml, Docker, Server integration(ssh, scp, etc), Json data extraction and compilation\
**Link:** https://github.com/ArenBabikian/Scenic/tree/master

### 3. [Database CLI](https://github.com/Harehn/COMP421)
_Group Project to make an interactive CLI to communicate with a remote database_

The goal of the project was to create a simple CLI to communicate with a remote DB2 database and perform
simple insert, select and delete operations. We took necessary steps to handle SQL exceptions. 
The initial table creations and initial insertion of data was done directly using sql files on the server side.

**Team Member:** [David Hamaoui](https://github.com/davidham96)\
**Languages:** Java, SQL(DB2)
**Technologies:** Server integration(ssh, scp, etc.), relational databases\

### 4. [Network Design](https://github.com/Kai-Cheng-WU/ECSE422)
_Group project to use different methods to calculate the reliability of a network_

Given an input of all possible network connections(cost and reliability), we are to find the best network given the cost.
We do this two different way with the first method being the brute method and the second being a more optimum one.
Our approach is to store intermediate values and thus reducing computing time.

**Team Member:** [Kaicheng Wu](https://github.com/Kai-Cheng-WU), [Andrei Sador](https://github.com/andrei-sandor)\
**Languages:** Python\

### 5. [OS Design](https://github.com/Harehn/COMP310-WINTER2024)
_Group Project to simulate the basic functions of an OS_

We simulated and debugged several functionalities of an OS such as the interpreter and shell memories. 
We also implemented program scheduling with their pcb and ready queue. 
Finally, we implemented the file system with local files acting as disks.
