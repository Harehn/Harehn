## Hi there!
<!--
**Harehn/Harehn** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

Welcome to my GitHub Profile.
I’m currently working on a [diceroller fullstack website](https://github.com/Harehn/DiceRoller) hosted on Render
[here](https://dicerollers.onrender.com/). 
But I have other repositories that may be interesting to you.

## About me
My preferred name is Nitin (He/Him). I recently graduated from Mcgill University in Bachelor of Software Engineering. 
I am quite passionate about programming and problems solving.
My language of choice is **Python** closely followed by **Java**.
I also have a lot of experience with **C**, **Ocaml** and **Javascript**. 
I have also dabbled in several other languages and frameworks.

I am currently very interested in designing tests, documentation and methods to write clean code.

## Proficiencies
**Concepts and frameworks:** Restful services, Domain Modelling (Code generation from UML), Data Structures and algorithms\
**Technologies:** Github, Command line and Terminal line, GUI, Front-end Development, Test Driven Development, Agile, Linux, Docker, Office Tools, Confluence, Trailhead, NSGA (AI), SAP ERP \
**Libraries:** Java FX, JavaSwing, Pytest, Mockito, pymoo, numpy

## Project
For more comprehensive list, click [here](Projects.md)

### 1. [Diceroller](https://github.com/Harehn/DiceRoller)
_A fullstack website to make dice rolls by parsing WOTC style formatted rolls_
This app uses a flask Backend and a Vue Frontend. This website Frontend is hosted [here](https://dicerollers.onrender.com/).
and communicates with the backend [here](https://diceroller-uwe7.onrender.com). 
A batch file also automates the running of the backend and frontend in development mode.

**Languages:** Python, HTML, JavaScript\
**Technologies:** Vue JS, Flask, Render(deployment)\

### 2. [Basics](https://github.com/Harehn/Basics)
_A personal project that demonstrates the basics of a programming language_

I have created this project to act as a cheatsheet for the languages I know. 
This makes it easy to refer back to what I know and also makes sure I have a basic grasp on a language.
The basics include Variable Types, Objects, Type Casting, Comments, Arithmetics, Arrays,
Logic Flow(IfElse, While/for loop etc.), Printing, User Input (Console and interactive),
Randomness, File IO and (Higher Order) Functions. I will occasionally add more depending on the language.

I also intend to add some sorting and miscellaneous code to these branches, so I can refer to them easily.

**Languages(So Far):** Python, Java, Ocaml, C, JavaScript\

### 3.  [Scenic](https://github.com/ArenBabikian/Scenic/tree/master)
_Capstone group project – Creating test cases for autonomous driving cars_

This was my final year project for Bachelor of Software Engineering. 
The project was initially forked by our supervisor from [BerkeleyLearnVerify](https://github.com/BerkeleyLearnVerify/Scenic).
Several iterations have been made on the project since. The project's goal is to create a simulation for autonomous vehicles
and to create test cases so that we can be more rigorous in software testing of autonomous vehicles.

Our group focused on the optimisation of SAT solving and NSGA creation of test cases. 

**Supervisor:** [Aren Babikian](https://github.com/ArenBabikian) \
**Team Members:** [Zhekai Jiang](https://github.com/zhekai-jiang), [Jerry Hou-Liu](https://github.com/JryHL), Oliver Huang\
**Language:** Python, Bash, markdown, Json \
**Technologies:** pytest, NSGA, pymoo, Poetry, Toml, Docker, Server integration(ssh, scp, etc), Json data extraction and compilation\
**Link:** https://github.com/ArenBabikian/Scenic/tree/master
