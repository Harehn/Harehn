## Hi there!

Welcome to my GitHub Profile.
I’m currently working on my [basics project](https://github.com/Harehn/Basics). 
But I have other repositories that may be interesting.

## About me
My preferred name is Nitin (He/Him). I recently graduated from Mcgill University. 
I am quite passionate about programming and problems solving.
My language of choice is **Python** closely followed by **Java**.
I also have a lot of experience with **C**, **Ocaml** and **Javascript**. 
I have also dabbled in several other languages and frameworks.


I am currently very interested in designing tests, documentation and methods to write clean code.


## Projects

1. ### [Basics](https://github.com/Harehn/Basics)
_A project that demonstrates the basics of a programming language_

I have created this project to act as a cheatsheet for the languages I know. 
This makes it easy to refer back to what I know and also makes sure I have a basic grasp on a language.
The basics include Variable Types, Objects, Type Casting, Comments, Arithmetics, Arrays,
Logic Flow(IfElse, While/for loop etc), Printing, User Input (Console and interactive),
Randomness, File IO and (Higher Order) Functions. I will occasionally add more depending on the language.

I also intend to add some sorting and miscellaneous code to these branches so I can refer to them easily.

**Languages(So Far):** Python, Java, Ocaml, C, JavaScript
